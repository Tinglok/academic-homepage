I am currently an undergraduate student in School of Computer Science and Technology, [Tiangong University](http://www.tiangong.edu.cn/) (Elite Class of Artificial Intelligence). Now I am working as a research intern in [Duke Kunshan University](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn/en), advised by [Ming Li](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/MingLi).

My research interests mainly focus on utterance-level speech modeling, particularly towards end-to-end approach based on deep neural network. Since Summer 2019, I have been studying in the area of speech processing in [Speech and Multimodal Intelligent Information Processing (SMIIP) Lab](https://sites.duke.edu/dkusmiip/) directed by Prof. Li.

In my spare time, I like to go to gyms,  which is my habit for nearly seven years.
