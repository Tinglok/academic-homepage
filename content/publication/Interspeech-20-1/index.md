abstract: "Previous research about deep learning-based target speaker separation used CNN-LSTM for modeling. In this paper, we propose an Attention-based neural network (Atss-Net) in the frequency domain for the task. It allows the network computing the correlation between each feature parallelly and automatically, and using shallower layers to extract more features, compared with CNN-LSTM architecture. Experimental results show that our Atss-Net yields better performance than the VoiceFilter proposed by Google, meanwhile it contains only half of the parameters. Besides, we do another experiment to prove that our model achieves good joint speech enhancement and separation performance."
