  # * Working with researchers from Samsung Speech Lab, I built a noise reduction system, which prepared to use as the front-end of intelligent devices;
  # * First we input the speaker utterance to get the speaker embedding, then we can input it together with the mixed utterance to the noise reduction system.
  # * With this system, we can get the clean utterance under the surrounding noise like songs, accompaniments, and other speakers' voice.
